\section{Structure of the thesis}

This thesis is organized as follows: Chapter 2 will offer an overview about Optimization Modulo Theories, Constraint Programming and their relationship. The chapter will also offer an introduction to OMT applications in Quantum computing, focusing on the SAT-to-Ising encoding problem and how Optimization Modulo Theories are applied in this task. Chapter 2 discusses the definition of a novel algorithm to refine the QUBO encoding in order to obtain more stable encodings. Chapter 3 discusses some tests performed to the post-process approach, showing performances and results. Chapter 4 summarizes the most relevant results and gives the conclusions, additionally offering some cues for future research work.
